Or it can be written with a string using the letters r, w, and x or - when the permission is not granted. For example: 640 is read/write for the owner, read for the group, and no permissions for the others; converted to a string, it would be: \"rw-r-----\" 755 is read/write/execute for the owner, and read/execute for group and others; converted to a string, it would be: \"rwxr-xr-x\" Fill in the blanks to make the code convert a permission in octal format into a string format."
