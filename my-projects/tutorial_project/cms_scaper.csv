Python Multiprocessing Tutorial: Run Code in Parallel Using the Multiprocessing Module,"In this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to run code in parallel using the multiprocessing module. We will also look at how to process multiple high-resolution images at the same time using a ProcessPoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module. Let’s get started…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKl2JW_qrso
Python Threading Tutorial: Run Code Concurrently Using the Threading Module,"In this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to run threads concurrently using the threading module. We will also look at how to download multiple high-resolution images online using a ThreadPoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module.

Update (2019-09-03),"Hey everyone. I wanted to give you an update on my videos. I will be releasing videos on threading and multiprocessing within the next week. Thanks so much for your patience. I currently have a temporary recording studio setup at my Airbnb that will allow me to record and edit the threading/multiprocessing videos. I am going to be moving into my new house in 10 days and once I have my recording studio setup then you can expect much faster video releases. I really appreciate how patient everyone has been while I go through this move, especially those of you who are contributing monthly through YouTube",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEEhzQoKtQU
Python Quick Tip: The Difference Between “==” and “is” (Equality vs Identity),"In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be learning the difference between using “==” and the “is” keyword when doing comparisons. The difference between these is that “==” checks to see if values are equal, and the “is” keyword checks their identity, which means it’s going to check if the values are identical in terms of being the same object in memory. We’ll learn more in the video. Let’s get started…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO_dS3rXDIs
Python Tutorial: Calling External Commands Using the Subprocess Module,"In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be learning how to run external commands using the subprocess module from the standard library. We will learn how to run commands, capture the output, handle errors, and also how to pipe output into other commands. Let’s get started…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fp1N6dof0Y
Visual Studio Code (Windows) – Setting up a Python Development Environment and Complete Overview,"In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be learning how to set up a Python development environment in VSCode on Windows. VSCode is a very nice free editor for writing Python applications and many developers are now switching over to this editor. In this video, we will learn how to install VSCode, get the Python extension installed, how to change Python interpreters, create virtual environments, format/lint our code, how to use Git within VSCode, how to debug our programs, how unit testing works, and more. We have a lot to cover, so let’s go ahead and get started…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20

Clarifying the Issues with Mutable Default Arguments,"In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be clarifying the issues with mutable default arguments. We discussed this in my last video titled “5 Common Python Mistakes and How to Fix Them”, but I received many comments from people who were still confused. So we will be doing a deeper dive to explain exactly what is going on here. Let’s get started…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JGmemuINww
5 Common Python Mistakes and How to Fix Them,"In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be going over some of the most common mistakes. I get a lot of questions from people every day, and I have seen a lot of people making these same mistakes in their code. So we will investigate each of these common mistakes and also look at the fixes for each other these as well. Here are the timestamps for each topic we will cover…
1) Indentation and Spaces – 0:45
2) Naming Conflicts – 4:12
3) Mutable Default Args – 10:05
4) Exhausting Iterators – 16:35
5) Importing with * – 22:13",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdJEYhA2AZQ
How I Setup a New Development Machine – Using Scripts to Automate Installs and Save Time,"In this video, I’ll be showing how I set up a new development machine. I recently got a new MacBook and wanted to show how I use scripts to automate a lot of this process. It used to take me a lot of time to install all of my software and get everything set up the way I like it. Now I use these automated scripts to do this in minutes. Let’s get started…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIdiWut8eD8
